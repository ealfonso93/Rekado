# Rekado
Payload launcher written in Kotlin for Nintendo Switch.

**Application doesn't require Root on your device.**

[SX Loader](https://sx.xecuter.com/) and [ReiNX](https://reinx.guide/) payloads bundled as default.

## Usage
* Launch application
* Find a cable to connect your device to the Nintendo Switch. For proper work, this should be a cable that is designed for data transmission, not just for charging. It is advisable to use an **A-to-C** cable and an **USB OTG** adapter.
* In the **"Payloads"** category, click the **"+"** button to select preloaded payload from your device's storage. Or simply transfer your payload to the Rekado folder in the device's memory. Or you can use the bundled payloads (**SX Loader/ReiNX**)
* Enter your Nintendo Switch into **RCM** mode in any convenient way. Your Nintendo Switch will power on by itself when plugged in, be sure to hold **VOLUME +**
* Connect the device to the Nintendo Switch and allow permission for the **USB** access if necessary. Wait unit payloads chooser dialog will be opened and select which one you want to load.
* Wait for payload to finish loading on your console

## Download

## FAQ
**Does application require Root?**

Application doesn't require Root on your device.

**Can it brick my device/console?**

This should not happen when using the "correct" payloads. But I am not responsible for possible problems.

**I want to help in Rekado's localization to my language, what should I do?**

Rekado's localization files placed in few places:
* \app\src\main\res\values\strings.xml
* \app\src\main\res\values\arrays.xml
* \konae\src\main\res\values\strings.xml

You should translate it. Files marked with **translatable="false"** should not be translated. After finishing create **Pull request** and your localization will be added in Rekado.
